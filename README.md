This repository presents an example of prediction of car prices using each car's age and technical performance. A baseline linear regression model is compared to 2 models generated by AutoML (H2O, TPOT).

<b>About the dataset.</b>

This dataset is a reduced version of this one:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/klkwak/toyotacorollacsv

Each row of the table presents the data of a transaction of selling a car: the properties of a car and the amount of transaction.

  The 9 features are:

* 5 numeric : Age, KM, HP, CC (== [Cubic capacity](https://www.cinch.co.uk/jargon/cc-cubic-capacity)), Weight;
* 3 categorical encoded by numbers: MetColor, Automatic, Doors ;
* 1 categorical encoded by string: FuelType (values: Petrol, Diesel, [CNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_vehicle))

<b>About the problem.</b>
The model accuracy is evaluated using its RMSE on the test set.

<b>Selected models and AutoML instruments.</b>

* Baseline: linear regression on 3 features 'Age', 'HP', 'Weight' (lin_reg_crossval.ipynb).
* model selected using H2O  (h2o_regression.ipynb)
* model selected using TPOT (TPOT_regression.ipynb, exported file: TPOT_regression.py).
RandomForestRegressor

EDA and the baseline model were run locally in the environment specified by the description file:
...

AutoML model selection was performed on the servers of GoogleColab. 

<b>Results.</b>
* RMSE of the baseline model: 1592$
* RMSE of the model selected by H20 in 1 minute: 1122$
* RMSE of the model selected by TPOT in 30 sec (RandomForestRegressor): 1195$
